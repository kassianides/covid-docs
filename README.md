# covid-docs
Translation of the Gov docs in english for aliens living and working in Cyprus. You can find the original forms in docx format in Greek and their translations in English, in docx and pdf format.
I believe the Gov will later update the documents in their legal form, but many of us will need them today before the end of the day to provide them to friends, family and employees.

Keep safe!
